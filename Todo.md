write recipe ingredient holder          <-|
write recipe add ingredient service ?   <-| could these be one

recipe holds each food report for ingredient
recipe is a storage container behaviours will be injected in or outside service
I will try both approaches and look up to see which one would be better
or a cleaner pattern
recipe totals up each nutrient  <-- or this could be an injected service
as it can be used for meal and day counter

Nutrient counter this can be injected into to sum up nutrients
and values added to a new array/hash storage.
Write add up nutrients
write meal holder
add to command line app

recipe ingredient holder
nutrient counter
tests for both

start integration testing
next stage, rails app
